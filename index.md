## About Me
Hi there, my name is Melvyn and I am from [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia). I have lived there for over 20 years and have recently come to the US for studies.
I am a Junior studying Mathematics - Computer Science at UCSD and I have been enjoying it very much so far! If you want to find out how I was first fascinated by Mathematics & Computer Science, click [here.](#about-me-programmer)
I have many hobbies which I will discuss further down the page, however if you would like to view my hobbies right now then click [here](#hobbies)

As you've read from the above, I am Malaysian! Malaysia is located in South-East Asia and is about 18 hours away by plane from San Diego. Malaysia is known for its rich culture, friendly people as well as amazing food. The weather in Malaysia is extremely predictable - it is always hot and humid all year round. It is normal to see Malaysians going about their day to day business in T-shirts, shorts and flip flops. Malaysia is a popular tourist attraction where some tourists have said 
> Malaysia is a country unlike any other: Full of promise and fragility. Its history, cultural and religious diversity make it a rich, compelling and surprising land.

## Hobbies
### Video Games
In my free time, I enjoy playing video games with my friends. I really enjoy playing team based games such as Dota 2, CSGO, RuneScape, and many other games. Additionally, I also really enjoy playing role-playing games such as Skyrim, Witcher 3 and Elden Ring. I think that Skyrim is by far my favorite role-playing game as there are so many builds and quests to complete that you could spent lots of hours on it and not get bored. The graphics on the game are also excellent and look very realistic.

### Other
Other than that, I also have other hobbies such as
- Socialising and meeting up with friends
- Watching action movies
- Trying out new foods and cooking

## About Me (Programmer)
### How I Started
When I was young, I had always found computers to be interesting. I was particularly interested to how it worked and I could interact with it when playing video games. I took my first programming class in high school and I was hooked by how I was able to tell computers what to do by writing in some instructions. My favorite programming statement by far has to be the `while` command where the computer is able to perform the same tasks over and over again until a condition is met. View my favorite programming language on my README.md file [here](README.md)
